# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

I wanted to clean this code up. Refactored code into Semantic HTML and grouped several things in the CSS style sheet that had the same properties. I didn't think about taking a photo of the code before the change until after I had already finished updating. 

## Installation

Should work on all devices with the link.
