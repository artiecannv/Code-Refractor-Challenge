# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

I wanted to clean this code up. Refactored code into Semantic HTML and grouped several things in the CSS style sheet that had the same properties. I have updated this after grading to reflect several more commits, a changed title, and better grouping on the CSS Style Sheet

## Installation

Should work on all devices with the link.
